### About Me 📄
As a Full Stack Developer with over 7 years of experience, I specialize in Frontend development, crafting dynamic and responsive Web and Mobile applications across various sectors including E-Commerce, Healthcare, and Finance. My proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue.js, and Angular, as well as mobile development using React Native, allows me to build intuitive, high-performance user interfaces that elevate user experience and engagement. In this long journey, I have contributed to a Texas, US-based remote team, worked with over 15+ global clients including the US, Canada, Germany, and India, and completed 30+ Frontend projects.

My deep understanding of UI/UX principles, combined with expertise in optimizing performance and scalability, allows me to deliver innovative solutions. I am currently seeking opportunities to work as a Frontend / Fullstack developer in a dynamic team environment where I can continue to expand my skills and contribute to impactful projects.🗺️⚔️🔥.
